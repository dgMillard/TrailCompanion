    \vspace{0.5cm}
    The Santiam wagon trail is historic trail located in the Willamette National Forest. The local ranger stations wish to have a mobile app that is capable of taking users on a tour the wagon trail without needing a connection to the internet. To accomplish this, we will be using packages featuring different aspects of the trail, including videos and text documents, that can be downloaded prior to arrival at the trail head. The app itself will be relatively small, as most of the content will be located within the content packages.  These content packages will be created by staff of the local ranger stations, and uploaded via a website that will be developed along with the mobile app. The app will be designed to work with both Android and iOS, and distributed via the App Store and Google Play.
