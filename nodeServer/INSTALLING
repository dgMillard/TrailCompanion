This project is designed to be run a machine with an up-to-date version of nodejs installed,
with an alias from node to nodejs. This project also requires a mysqli (httpd) process to be 
configured and running, where the credentials are stored in a file called security.json, which 
should be found in the same directory as the server.js file (TrailCompanion/nodeServer/source).

This json config file should follow this format:

{
  "database": {
    "username": "dbUsername",
    "password": "hopefullySecurePassword",
    "name": "Database name here"
  },

  "session": "uniqueSeedForSessionCookies"
}


In addition, you must run "npm install" in the same directory as the server.js file, before starting the server.
Once you are ready to attempt to launch it, you may start it with "node server.js" from within the source folder.
